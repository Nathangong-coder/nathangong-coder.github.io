    <h1 class="grid-item losfeliz">Why should you learn and play bridge?</h1>
    <h2 class="losfeliz"> 1. Those who play more bridge frequently score higher on cognitive tests.</h2>
    <h2 class="losfeliz"> 2. Bridge games offer intellectual and social stimulation on a routine basis.</h2>
    <h2 class="losfeliz"> 3. An area in the brain used in playing bridge stimulates the immune system. Researchers suggest that is because players must use memory, visualization and sequencing.</h2>
    <h2 class="losfeliz"> 4. Any activity from which you derive pleasure prevents the onset of classic depression. Players are less likely to be depressed; hence, they sleep better, tend to exercise more and have a better life in general.</h2>
    <h2 class="losfeliz"> 5. Multiple changes in lifestyle (e.g. cognitive training and social activity, two of bridge’s chief benefits) can improve memory and thinking in those at risk for cognitive decline.</h2>
    <h2 class="losfeliz"> 6. Playing bridge can help any person retain their mental sharpness.</h2>
    <h2 class="losfeliz"> 7. The frequency of playing games is associated with greater brain volume in several regions that are affected by Alzheimer’s disease.</h2>
    <h2 class="losfeliz"> 8. Successful people play bridge! Warren Buffet and Bill Gates are considered to be two of the smartest entrepreneurs in America. Both are also very accomplished bridge players.</h2>

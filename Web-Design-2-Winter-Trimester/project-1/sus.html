        <h4 class="grid-item h2 losfeliz">But what is suspicious and suspiciousness?</h4>

        <p class="citadelbold p1 grid-item">Suspicious is an adjective that describes the state of being suspicious. It means having doubts or mistrust toward someone or something. When someone is acting suspiciously, they may be behaving in a way that is unusual or unexpected, and this
            can cause others to become suspicious of them. For example, if someone is acting nervously or evasively, they may be viewed as suspicious. Suspicious behavior can also include things like avoiding eye contact, refusing to answer questions,
            or trying to cover up or hide something.</p>
        <p class="citadelbold p2 grid-item">Suspiciousness is the state of being suspicious or distrustful. It is a feeling of doubt or mistrust toward someone or something. This feeling can arise when there is a lack of information or evidence, or when there are inconsistencies or discrepancies
            in what is known. Suspiciousness can also be a result of past experiences or a general tendency to be mistrustful. In some cases, it may be warranted, but in others, it may be unfounded and lead to misunderstandings or conflicts.</p>
        <p class="citadelbold p3 grid-item">Suspicions are feelings of doubt or mistrust toward someone or something. They are often based on incomplete or insufficient information, and they can arise when something seems unusual or out of the ordinary. Suspicions can also be based on past
            experiences or a general tendency to be mistrustful. When someone has suspicions about someone or something, they may try to gather more information or evidence in order to confirm or dispel their doubts. In some cases, suspicions may be justified,
            but in others, they may be unfounded and lead to misunderstandings or conflicts.</p>

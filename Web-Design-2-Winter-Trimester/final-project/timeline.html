            <h2 class="centered-header">Biography</h2>
            <p class="description">I was born in Kirkland, WA, in November 2006. I grew up in a competitive but fun environment, an environment that encouraged STEM learning, which has shaped my interests in math, investing, and bridge. I love to play bridge and tennis, and
                love to take photos when I have the chance. I learned bridge at a summer camp, and have loved it ever since. I learned tennis and photography from my grandpa, who still teaches me new things in these areas to this day.</p>
            <p class="description">Currently, I am a sophomore at Eastside Preperatory School, and I hope to be an investor or work some other job in finance during the future.</p>
            <p class="description">I am a very hardworking and dedicated bridge player, tennis player, and mathematician, that is interested in all things finance. My activities are mostly based on math, making me extremely suitable for analytical work. Although I don't have
                much experience in finance, I have self-studied many books on the subject.</p>

            <h2 class="centered-header">Profile</h2>
            <p class="description">I am a good junior bridge player that has won a couple of regional events. Recently, I was in the top 50 for a national event, and was selected to be one of the U21 US representatives in the junior world championships. Outside of bridge, I
                have many hobbies that I have developed, including photography, tennis, and biking. I have also been mentioned in the national bridge magazine, the ACBL magazine. </p>
            <p class="description">Outside of bridge, I haven't won many awards, as I have not formally entered many competitions in these respective areas, but I plan to compete and win some awards in these places soon as well.</p>
            <p class="description">I founded my charity, Bridge BC, with one of my best friends, Oren Gershony, when we wanted to start bridge clubs at a large scale. This charity was started informally years ago, but we formally founded it in February, 2023. We got the idea
                when I first started a bridge club at one of my former schools, Evergreen Middle School. I tend to find inspiration and motivation wherever, with ideas coming to me sporadically.</p>

    <h2 class="citadel grid-item">To demonstrate how bridge is played, we will start with the basics. There are 52 cards used in the game of bridge (jokers aren't part of bridge), with the A being the biggest card. There are 4 suits, each with 13 cards: spades, hearts, diamonds and
        clubs. </h2><br>

    <h2 class="citadel grid-item">We first need to know what phases of bridge there are. There are 2 phases to bridge, the 1st is a bidding auction, where highest number & suit wins (up to 7NT). The 2nd is a playing aspect of the game, where you try to take as many tricks as you can
        (a trick is won when everyone plays a card, and with you playing highest card in a suit [spade, heart, diamond, or club], or with the highest ruff [we'll talk about that later])</h2>
